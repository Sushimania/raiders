## What is raiders? 

Raiders are programs that randomly find Bitcoin. Do you have a challenge to find treasure?

## About raiders

Raiders is a program developed in Go. I was inspired by the allprivatekeys.com. It would be a great thing for you to find the address that has Bitcoin.

## How does it work?

If you find an address that contains a bitcoin, it will stop searching automatically. You can obtain a bit coin with a private key.

Raiders generate a random and infinite private key. If the private key is generated, the number of powers of 2 is 256. The probability of matching an existing address is close to 0. But a lucky person might discover something.
